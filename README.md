### `Alternative approach to Hierarchical Tree with Levels of Abstrtaction`

This is a hierarchical tree representation of POI sequence A3 Destination data, that had its own unique character of having ~[10-20] nodes or leafs with multi level leaf metrics(size). So with the following hierarchical tree implements few different levels of abstraction to slice and dice the given data maintaining hierarchy. This is achieved with the help of user interactions with the tree nodes coupled with breakdown of corresponding data and depth of nodes.

Other displays of hierarchical structures such as a Sunburst has its own set of chalenges such as: [1] Labels, very hard to represent. [2] Angles are hard to read. [3] Deeper slices are exagerated compared to inner levels.
